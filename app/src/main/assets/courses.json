  "description": "<p><strong>Now with over 10 hours of React content.&nbsp; Just updated on May 15th, 2023.</strong></p><p>Massive new React \"expansion pack\" covers: React basics, JSX, props, state, Vite, MaterialUI, hooks, useEffect, React design patterns, and more.</p><p>Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.&nbsp; This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the <strong>only course you need to learn web development. </strong>There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.&nbsp; Here's why:</p><ul><li><p><strong>This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>92% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs</strong>. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.</p></li><li><p>The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost <strong>$14,000 and $21,000</strong>.&nbsp; This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.</p></li><li><p>Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market.<strong> This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course! </strong></p></li><li><p>We build 13+ projects, including a <strong>gigantic production application </strong>called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.</p></li><li><p>The course is <strong>constantly updated</strong> with new content, projects, and modules.&nbsp; Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.</p></li><li><p>You get to meet my cats and chickens! </p></li></ul><p>When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the \"beginner friendly\" classes.&nbsp; With this course, you get the best of both worlds.&nbsp; This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.</p><p>Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p>Flexbox</p></li><li><p>Responsive Design</p></li><li><p><strong>JavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript </strong>- Promises, async/await, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>AJAX </strong>and single page apps</p></li><li><p>Bootstrap 4 and 5 </p></li><li><p><strong>ReactJS</strong></p></li><li><p>SemanticUI</p></li><li><p>Bulma CSS Framework</p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p>Unix(Command Line) Commands</p></li><li><p><strong>NodeJS</strong></p></li><li><p>NPM</p></li><li><p><strong>ExpressJS</strong></p></li><li><p>Templating</p></li><li><p><strong>REST</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong>&nbsp;vs. <strong>NoSQL</strong> databases</p></li><li><p><strong>MongoDB</strong></p></li><li><p>Database Associations</p></li><li><p><strong>Schema Design</strong></p></li><li><p>Mongoose</p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication From Scratch</strong></p></li><li><p>Cookies &amp; Sessions</p></li><li><p>Authorization</p></li><li><p><strong>Common Security Issues - SQL&nbsp;Injection, XSS, etc.</strong></p></li><li><p>Developer Best Practices</p></li><li><p><strong>Deploying Apps</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Cloud Databases</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Image Upload </strong>and Storage</p></li><li><p><strong>Maps and Geocoding</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of \"watch as I code\" videos.&nbsp; This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:<br></p><ul><li><p>Lectures</p></li><li><p>Code-Alongs</p></li><li><p>Projects</p></li><li><p>Exercises</p></li><li><p>Research Assignments</p></li><li><p>Slides</p></li><li><p>Downloads</p></li><li><p>Readings</p></li><li><p>Too many pictures of my dog Rusty</p></li></ul><p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.&nbsp; I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.&nbsp; Sign up today and see how fun, exciting, and rewarding web development can be!</p>",

You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls.

Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.\"</em></p><p><strong>This Course uses TypeScript</strong></p><p>TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular&nbsp;team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular&nbsp;apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular&nbsp;apps. Check out the free videos for more information.</p><p>TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.</p><p><strong>Why Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular&nbsp;is the next big deal.

  "description": "<p><strong><em>*Update 2024:&nbsp;ChatGPT for Data Science added*</em></strong></p><p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And how can you do that? &nbsp; </p><p>Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture &nbsp; </p><p><strong>The Solution</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mathematics &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Machine Learning &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Deep Learning &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2024.</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field <strong>– having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skills</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>\nAs a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.\n&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data <em>scientist </em>from a data <em>analyst. </em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for <em>you</em> to control the machines. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>**What you get**</strong></p><ul><li><p>A $1250 data science training program&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A community of data science learners &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access to future updates &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>\n\n&nbsp; We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee. No risk for you. The content of the course is excellent, and this is a no-brainer for us, as we are certain you will love it.</p><p><strong>Why wait?

I will wait here...</p><p>...</p><p>Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?</p><p>Well, I'm here to teach you<strong> HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw</strong>, step-by-step.</p><p>So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.</p><p>But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to <strong>enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!</p></li><li><p>How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).</p></li><li><p>How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs</p></li><li><p>How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)</p></li><li><p>How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching</p></li><li><p>How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons</p></li><li><p>Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools</p></li></ul><p><strong>Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today!</strong></p><p><em>Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading...</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?</strong></p><p>Building websites allows you to do <strong>fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well</strong>. Web development is one of the <strong>most future-proof and highest-paying industries</strong> in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!</p><p>This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an <strong>all-in-one package</strong> that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Reason #1: The course is completely project-based</em></strong></p><p>Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by <strong>building actual projects</strong>! In the final project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a <strong>fictional company</strong> that I made up just for the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code</em></strong></p><p>Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire <strong>7-step process</strong> of building and launching our website project.</p><p>So the huge Omnifood project will teach you <strong>real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites</strong>: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.</p><p>On top of that, this course has a <strong>huge focus on beautiful design</strong>. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you</em></strong></p><p>With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be <strong>quite easy and fun to learn</strong>. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.</p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and <strong>designed the ideal course curriculum</strong> for every type of student. It's a <strong>unique blend</strong> of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Why is this course so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> I take time to <strong>explain every single concept</strong> that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (<strong>this is a course</strong>, not a tutorial)</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually <strong>assimilate and practice</strong> what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] Here is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.</p></li><li><p>... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.</p></li><li><p>... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).</p></li></ul><p>Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>So, does all of this sound great? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start your web development journey today!</em></strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>Whether you want to:</p><p>- build the skills you need to get your first Python programming job</p><p>- move to a more senior software developer position</p><p>- get started with Machine Learning, Data Science, Django or other hot areas that Python specialises in</p><p>- or just learn Python to be able to create your own Python apps quickly.</p><p>…then you need a solid foundation in Python programming. And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.</p><p>This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.</p><p>The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.</p><p>And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.</p><p>By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.</p><p>Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.</p><p>“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria<br> <br>“I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get \"stitched\" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin<br> <br>“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen<br> <br>And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.</p><p><strong>Will this course give you core python skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.</p><p><strong>Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?</strong></p><p>No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.</p><p>Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.</p><p>This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.</p><p>By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above. </p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.</p><p>You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.</p><p>As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.  </p><p>And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.</p><p>This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><p>·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p><p>·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.</p><p>·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.</p><p>·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.</p><p>·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.</p><p>(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).<br> <br><strong>Does the course get updated?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br> <br> A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.</p><p>For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.</p><p>We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.</p><p><strong><em>What if you have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p>That’s just one reason why Tim was voted <strong>top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards</strong> (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  </p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger</p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enrol now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Python brilliance. Or, take this course for a free spin using the preview feature, so you know you’re 100% certain this course is for you. </p><p><strong>See you on the inside <em>(hurry, your Python class is waiting!)</em></strong></p>",

  "description": "<p>This course was<strong> just completely redone and rebuilt</strong> from the ground up, with over 325 brand new videos recorded. The course now uses <strong>MySQL 8.x</strong> and covers new topics including: <strong>Window Functions</strong>, <strong>Views</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>SQL&nbsp;modes</strong>.</p><p>If you want to learn how to gain insights from data but are too intimidated by databases to know where to start, then this course is for you. This course is a gentle but comprehensive introduction to MySQL, one of the <strong>most highly in-demand skills</strong> in the business sector today. &nbsp;</p><p>Whether you work in sales or marketing, you run your own company, or you want to build your own apps, mastering MySQL is crucial to answering complex business problems and questions using insights from data. <em>The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp</em> introduces you to a solid foundation in databases in a way that’s both informative and engaging. Yes, that’s right, it’s possible to make an engaging course on databases. &nbsp;</p><p>In this course, you will:</p><ul><li><p>Learn the ins and outs of <strong>SQL syntax</strong></p></li><li><p>Generate reports using <strong>sales and user data</strong></p></li><li><p>Analyze data using <strong>Aggregate Functions</strong></p></li><li><p>Run complex queries using MySQL<strong> logical operators and string functions</strong></p></li><li><p>Write all the common <strong>SQL joins</strong></p></li><li><p>Work with <strong>large datasets containing thousands of entries</strong></p></li><li><p>Design and implement complex database schemas</p></li><li><p>Learn to navigate the treacherous world of storing dates and times</p></li><li><p>Clone the database structure of a <strong>photo sharing social network</strong></p></li><li><p>Work with <strong>MySQL 8.x Window Functions</strong>: RANK, LEAD, LAG, NTILE, etc.</p></li><li><p>Create <strong>MySQL database views</strong> and virtual tables</p></li></ul><p>This course is also chock full of<strong> exercises, challenges, projects, and opportunities</strong> for you to practice what you’re learning. Apply what you’re learning to real-world challenges such as finding a website’s power users, calculating your top students, identifying bots on a site, or determining which hashtags generate the most traction on a site. Along the way, you’ll also get to meet my pet cat, Blue! (She’s really cute.)</p><p><strong>Why Learn MySQL</strong></p><p>Consistently ranked the most in-demand skill in recent employer surveys, SQL is a fantastic way to increase your income and boost your professional development. So many companies today use MySQL, including Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Github, Kickstarter, Udemy, Slack, and many others. <strong>Unsure about the difference between SQL and MySQL?</strong> MySQL is the most popular open source SQL database out there, so it’s a great choice to begin your learning journey. We’ll talk a lot more about the difference between SQL and MySQL in the course, but 95% of what you learn about MySQL in this course will apply to other databases such as Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</p><p><strong>Why This Course Is Different &nbsp;</strong></p><p>This isn’t going to be a course where you watch me code for 20 hours; it’s a course with <strong>ample opportunity for you to get your hands dirty writing code</strong> (even within the first 7 minutes of the course).</p><p>My teaching experience is rooted in the classroom. I’ve spent years teaching programming, web development, and databases to my in-person bootcamp students. This course combines the best of my offline courses with the convenience of learning online, in a setting that’s best for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Upon completing this course, you’ll be able to interact with and query any SQL database out there. You’ll also be able to generate reports with ease, answer company performance questions using data, and integrate MySQL into complete applications.</p><p><strong>So let’s do this! Enroll today and start learning SQL!</strong></p>",

She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it, as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST Swift programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.\" - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>\"SO GOOD!!! </em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\"</em> - Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>\"Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!\"</em> - Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\" - Marc</em></p><p><em>\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.\"</em> - Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!\"</em> - Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.\" - Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" - Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\" - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \"just do this. You will see why later.\" She goes into the </em><strong><em>reason for doing something</em></strong><em> before doing it.\"</em> - Clyde Addison</p><p><strong>Do you have some experience developing iOS apps and wonder if this course is for you? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>\"This is the best-organized course for starting Swift that I've seen. The course is excellent for teaching Swift programming including vital information using Xcode, Github, Cocoapods, Stack Overflow, Alamofire, Firebase, REST APIs and all the services commonly used by app developers. They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly. </em><strong><em>Wish I had this course a year ago</em></strong><em> but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone's instructional videos, seriously. :)\" - Marcy Vernon</em></p><p><em>\"Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming. I've been coding for years and taken many programming related classes on Udemy and this is def. one of the best. The instructor walks you through all the in's and out's of developing apps for the iOS platform. </em><strong><em>Top Shelf A++ class</em></strong><em>.\"</em> - Mirko Cukich</p><p><strong>REMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for 30 days! So it's a complete no-brainer, sign up today with ZERO risk and EVERYTHING to gain.</strong></p><p>So what are you waiting for?

<strong>fully up to date</strong> and <strong>covers the latest versions of Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 and Hibernate</strong> <strong>6</strong>. The course also <strong>includes new content on Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST and Thymeleaf</strong>.</p><p>Beware of other Udemy Spring/Hibernate courses. Most of them are outdated and use old versions of Spring and Hibernate. Don’t waste your time or money on learning outdated technology.</p><p>Also, I create all of the <strong>code from scratch in this course</strong>. Beware of other courses, those instructors simply copy/paste from their github repo or they use pre-written code. Their approach is not ideal for real-time learning.</p><p>Take <strong>my course</strong> where I show you how to <strong>create all of the code from scratch</strong>. You can<strong> type the code along with me in the videos</strong>, which is the<strong> best way to learn</strong>.</p><p>I am a <strong>very responsive instructor</strong> and I am available to <strong>answer your questions </strong>and help you work through any problems.</p><p>Finally, all source code is provided with the course along with setup instructions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Student Reviews Prove This Course's Worth</strong></p><p>Those who have reviewed the course have pointed out that <strong>the instruction is clear and easy to follow</strong>, as well as thorough and highly informative.</p><p>Many students had also taken other Spring Boot and Hibernate courses in the past, only to find that <strong>this Spring Boot and Hibernate course was their favorite</strong>. They enjoyed the <strong>structure of the content</strong> and <strong>the high quality audio/video</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample of the Student Reviews:</strong></p><p><em>Best Spring Boot course by far </em><strong><em>across all learning platforms</em></strong><em> for me. Best course structure and instructor always demonstrates in depth knowledge by covering the necessary basics. Really really incredible good presentation and structure, a lot of other instructors can learn a lot from you Chad. - Muzi P.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>I worked in some company, so I can say that this course is 100% industry oriented. The best course for learning Spring Framework. Getting replies within 24 hours.</em> - Premang</p><p><br></p><p><em>Chad Darby has done a </em><strong><em>superb job organizing this course</em></strong><em>, and has </em><strong><em>made Spring Framework, MVC, AOP, Hibernate, Security easy to learn and use</em></strong><em>. I have a bs and ms in CS, have been developing software for 25 years, and have taken many courses over the years at the different companies I've been at and Chad is easily the best instructor I've had. </em>- Dave Zeltserman</p><p><br></p><p><em>This is </em><strong><em>the best tutorial I've seen so far for Spring/Hibernate</em></strong><em>, each step is well explained and the tutorial videos are made to a high standard. I highly recommend this course!</em> - Rob</p><p><br></p><p><em>Hats off to you Chad, </em><strong><em>the best Spring fundamentals course I have done on Udemy</em></strong><em> thus far. You never disappoint.</em> - Morebodi Modise</p><p><br></p><p><em>Chad is an excellent natural teacher. His </em><strong><em>course is well organized</em></strong><em>. He </em><strong><em>makes difficult concepts very easy to understand</em></strong><em>. </em>- Julie Hodgson</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quality Material</strong></p><p>You will receive a quality course, with solid technical material and excellent audio and video production.</p><p>My courses have <strong>received rave 5 star reviews </strong>and <strong>over 700,000 students have taken the courses</strong>. Also, these courses are <strong>the most popular courses in their respective categories.</strong></p><p>Similar thing for this Spring Boot course, it is ranked as <strong>#1 best seller for Spring courses</strong>.</p><p>I also have an <strong>active YouTube channel</strong> where I post regular videos. In the past year, I’ve created over 300 video tutorials (public and private). My YouTube channel has <strong>over 6.8 million views</strong> and <strong>40k</strong> subscribers. So I understand what works and what doesn’t work for creating video tutorials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>No Risk – Udemy Refund</strong></p><p>Finally, <strong>there is no risk</strong>. You can preview 25% of the course for free. Once you purchase the course, if for some reason you are not happy with the course, <strong>Udemy offers a 30-day refund (based on Udemy's Refund Policy)</strong>.</p><p>So you have nothing to lose, <strong>sign up for this course and learn how to build Spring Boot and Hibernate Real-Time Projects from scratch!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p><ul><li><p>Java Developers with basic Java experience</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>Have you tried to learn Node before? You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p><strong>I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.</strong></p><p>The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.</p><p>The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.</p><p><strong>The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.</strong></p><p>From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.</p><p>You’ll be building four projects:</p><p>1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet</p><p>2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs</p><p>3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication</p><p>4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion</p><p>By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.</p><p><strong>When learning, learn the latest.</strong></p><p>I work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with the latest Node.js version.</p><p>You’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.</p><p><strong>Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.</strong></p><p>You can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.</p><p><strong>There’s no better time to learn Node.</strong></p><p>According to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.</p><p><strong>You might get stuck. But I’m here to help.</strong></p><p>There’s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.</p><p>I’m in the Q&amp;A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.</p><p><strong>Don’t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.</strong></p><p><em>“Any questions people seem to have are answered swiftly, clearly, and often with examples posted on GitHub. Even when the questions asked are out of the scope of the course Andrew seems to come up trumps.\"</em> - Adam Tait</p><p><em>\"This is amazing. What's even better is the instructor answered all the questions I asked.\"</em> - Pak Chu</p><p><em>\"The real value in this course is Andrew; he is not just a great teacher, but also he's quick to answer questions and provide feedback.\"</em> - Nick Hester</p><p>I guarantee this is the most up-to-date and engaging Node course available, and it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p><p><strong>During eight chapters you'll learn:</strong></p><p>1. Node.js</p><p>2. Npm</p><p>3. Asynchronous programming</p><p>4. ES6/ES7</p><p>5. MongoDB</p><p>6. Express</p><p>7. Socket.IO</p><p>8. JWT Authentication</p><p>9. Mongoose</p><p>10. File and image uploads</p><p>11. Email sending</p><p>12. Application deployment with Heroku</p><p>13. Version control with Git</p><p>14. GitHub</p><p>15. REST API Design</p><p>16. Code testing</p><p>17. Debugging</p><p>18. Jest</p><p>19. Many more tools</p><p>I can’t wait to see you on the inside!</p><p>- Andrew</p>",

  "description": "<p>Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers? &nbsp;<strong>C++</strong></p><p>Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume, &nbsp;will often get you a job interview? &nbsp;<strong>C++&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years? <strong>&nbsp;C++</strong></p><p><strong>Why you should learn C++</strong></p><p>Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only is C++ popular, but it&nbsp;is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.</p><p>There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.&nbsp;These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!</p><p>Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, &nbsp;the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.</p><p>Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.</p><p><strong>Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?</strong></p><p>If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.</p><p>But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ &nbsp;is because it is so powerful!</p><p>What do I mean by powerful?</p><p><strong>C++ is&nbsp;super fast and&nbsp;is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.</strong></p><p>It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.</p><p>C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.</p><p>That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.</p><p>Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.</p><p><strong>How can a beginner learn C++?</strong><br><br>Find&nbsp;a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.</p><p>Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. &nbsp;He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.</p><p>So not&nbsp;only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught&nbsp;at university level for many years.</p><p>As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p><strong>Which version of C++ should I learn?</strong></p><p>C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. &nbsp;It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.</p><p>Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17). &nbsp;</p><p>Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.</p><p><strong>What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?</strong></p><p>This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.&nbsp; </p><p>C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.<br><br>What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course. <br><br>It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.<br><br>And even if you really do want to learn C++20,&nbsp; the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.<br><br>If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.</p><p>Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!</p><p><strong>Is C++ difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.</p><p>There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.</p><p>But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can&nbsp;get up to speed with C++ quickly,&nbsp;and that's what this course is all about.</p><p><strong>What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.</p><p>Key topics covered include.</p><p>* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion<br>* Performing calculations and displaying results<br>* Functions<br>* Pointers<br>* Using existing classes and creating objects<br>* Creating your own classes<br>* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector<br>* Constructors and Destructors<br>* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment&nbsp;<br>* How to overload operators<br>* Using inheritance and class hierarchies<br>* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding&nbsp;<br>* Using smart pointers<br>* Using stream I/O<br>* An introduction to the C++ STL<br>* An introduction to Exception Handling<br>* And much more.</p><p><br><strong>How is this C++ course different from other courses?<br><br></strong>You will learn Modern C++, for one. &nbsp;<strong>Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.</strong> &nbsp;If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.</p><p>The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.</p><p>You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as&nbsp;your instructor Frank has.</p><p><strong>What do I get out of learning C++?</strong></p><p>More career options for one! &nbsp;C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development. &nbsp; &nbsp;It's also heavily used in embedded applications. &nbsp;Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!</p><p><strong>Are you ready to get started?</strong></p><p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you! </p><p>Your new job or consulting opportunity&nbsp;awaits! &nbsp;\n</p><p>Why not get started today?</p><p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Signup</strong>&nbsp;button to sign up for the course!</p>",

We'll cover all the core basics but we'll not stop thereafter - this course also dives into advanced concepts like the Composition API introduced with Vue 3.</p><p>Frontend frameworks like Vue JS are <strong>extremely popular</strong> because they give us this reactive, great user experience we know from mobile apps - but now in the browser! No wonder that <strong>jobs</strong> requiring frontend framework skills like VueJS are amongst the <strong>best paid</strong> ones in the industry!</p><p>You may know Angular 2+ and ReactJS, well, <strong>VueJS combines the best of both frameworks</strong> and makes building anything from <strong>small widgets to big, enterprise-level apps</strong> a breeze and a whole lot of fun!</p><p>And if you don't know the two mentioned frameworks: That's fine, too, <strong>this course does not expect any knowledge</strong> of any other frontend framework - you will learn it all throughout this Course!</p><p><strong>This course covers it all!</strong></p><p>We'll start at the very basics, what Vue.js is and how it works before we move on to more complex and advanced topics but I'll be honest: It's too much to fit it all into one sentence, so here's what you'll learn in this Course:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What</strong> is VueJS and <strong>Why</strong> would you use it?</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Basics</strong> (including the basic Syntax, Understanding Templates and much more!)</p></li><li><p>How to Output <strong>Reactive Data</strong> &amp; Listen to <strong>Events</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Interacting with DOM</strong> (Rendering Lists, Conditionally attaching/ detaching Elements ...)</p></li><li><p>Setting up a <strong>Development Environment</strong> and <strong>Workflow</strong></p></li><li><p>Using <strong>Components</strong> (and what Components are to begin with)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Deep Dive Look Behind the Scenes</strong> of Vue</p></li><li><p>Binding to <strong>Form</strong> Inputs</p></li><li><p>Sending <strong>Http Requests</strong> to Backend APIs</p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong> &amp; Vue</p></li><li><p>How to make your App more Beautiful with <strong>Animations</strong> and <strong>Transitions</strong></p></li><li><p>How to create an awesome <strong>Single-Page-Application</strong> (SPA) with <strong>Routing</strong></p></li><li><p>How to improve State Management by using <strong>Vuex</strong></p></li><li><p>How to <strong>Deploy</strong> the App</p></li><li><p><strong>And much more!</strong></p></li></ul><p>All these topics are taught with<strong> real examples and demo projects.</strong> This course is full of exercises, challenges and bigger courser projects that allow you to practice what you learned.</p><p>Along with <strong>many other smaller projects</strong>, we will build a <strong>couple of bigger main projects</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>\"Monster Slayer\" Game</strong> - a game running in the browser, 100% powered by Vue</p></li><li><p>The <strong>\"Learning Resource Manager\" </strong>- a web app that allows you to manage (add, delete, list) your favorite learning resources</p></li><li><p>The <strong>\"Find a Coach\" app</strong> - a web app that allows you to sign up / login, register as a coach, list and filter available coaches and send messages to coaches</p></li></ul><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>Now that you know what this course is about, let's see if this course is for you!</p><p><strong>Here are three types of students who will love this course:</strong></p><p><strong>Student #1:</strong></p><p>Has some JavaScript experience and is interested in what this language can do. You heard and read that JavaScript allows you to create nice web applications and enhance existing web pages. VueJS is your choice!</p><p><strong>Student #2:</strong></p><p>You already have some experience with other frontend frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS. But either due to interest or disappointment of the existing frameworks, you seek some alternatives - VueJS might be what you were looking for!</p><p><strong>Student #3:</strong></p><p>Has experience with backend frameworks/ languages but now also wants to enter the frontend world. VueJS is an awesome choice here, it's fun, it uses native JS and it's extremely powerful!</p><p><strong>Bonus: Student #4</strong></p><p>Is disappointed by Angular 2+. Does a good framework need 2 hours of setup? No, certainly not - as VueJS will prove to this student!</p><p><strong>Let's dive into VueJS right now!</strong></p>",

You will learn it.  <strong>AWS Deployment</strong>? Included.  <strong>Kubernetes in Production</strong>? Of course!</p><p>This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy <em>any</em> web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Docker from Scratch!</strong></p><p>In this course you'll <strong>learn Docker from absolute fundamentals</strong>, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as \"What is a container?\" and \"How does a container work?\".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a <strong>deep dive on the inner workings of containers</strong>, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.  </p><p><br></p><p><strong>CI + CD Pipelines</strong></p><p>Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement <strong>a full CI + CD workflow </strong>using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that <strong>automatically deploys your code</strong> every time you push your latest changes to Github!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!</strong></p><p>After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container <strong>deployments on Amazon Web Services.  </strong>You will construct a multi-container application utilizing <strong>Node, React, Redis, and Postgres</strong>, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kubernetes!</strong></p><p>Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the <strong>right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster</strong> - this course doesn't have any of those annoying <em>\"don't do this in production\" </em>comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to <strong>set up HTTPS on Kubernetes</strong>, which is harder than it sounds!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here's what you'll do:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn Docker from scratch, <strong>no previous experience required</strong></p></li><li><p>Build your own <strong>custom images </strong>tailored to your applications</p></li><li><p>Master the Docker CLI to <strong>inspect and debug</strong> running containers</p></li><li><p>Understand <strong>how Docker works</strong> behind the scenes, and what a container is</p></li><li><p>Build a<strong> CI + CD pipeline</strong> from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatically deploy</strong> your code when it is pushed to Github!</p></li><li><p>Build a <strong>complex multi-container application</strong> from scratch and deploy it to AWS</p></li><li><p>Understand the purpose and <strong>theory of Kubernetes</strong></p></li><li><p>Deploy a<strong> production-ready Kubernetes</strong> Cluster to Google Cloud</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p><strong>It's time to become a modern and complete Python developer! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto.</strong> <strong>Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.</strong></p><p>Learn Python from scratch, get hired, and have fun along the way with the most modern, up-to-date Python course on Udemy (we use the latest version of Python). This course is focused on efficiency: never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete Python tutorials anymore. </p><p>This comprehensive and<strong> </strong>project based course<strong> will introduce you to all of the modern skills of a Python developer (Python 3) and along the way, we will build over 12 real world projects to add to your portfolio </strong>(You will get access to all the the code from the 12+ projects we build, so that you can put them on your portfolio right away)!</p><p><br>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of becoming a professional Python developer.&nbsp;We will start from the very beginning by teaching you Python basics and programming fundamentals, and then going into advanced topics and different career fields in Python so you can get real life practice and be ready for the real world. <br><br>The topics covered in this course are:</p><p><br></p><p>- <strong>Programming Fundamentals</strong></p><p>- <strong>Python Basics</strong></p><p><strong>- Python Fundamentals</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Structures</strong></p><p><strong>- Object Oriented Programming with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Functional Programming with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Lambdas</strong></p><p><strong>- Decorators</strong></p><p><strong>- Generators</strong></p><p><strong>- Testing in Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Debugging</strong></p><p><strong>- Error Handling</strong></p><p><strong>- Regular Expressions</strong></p><p><strong>- Comprehensions</strong></p><p><strong>- Modules</strong></p><p><strong>- Virtual Environments</strong></p><p><strong>- Developer Environments (PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, VS&nbsp;Code, Sublime Text + more)</strong></p><p><strong>- File Processing: Image, CSV, PDFs, Text + more</strong></p><p><strong>- Web Development with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Machine Learning with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Science with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Automation with Python and Selenium</strong></p><p><strong>- Scripting with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Web Scraping with Python and BeautifulSoup</strong></p><p><strong>- Image Detection</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Visualizations</strong></p><p><strong>- Kaggle, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn</strong></p><p><strong>- Email and SMS with Python</strong></p><p><strong>- Working with APIs (Twitter Bot, Password&nbsp;Checker, Translator)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will be a complete Python developer that can get hired at large companies. We are going to use Python to work with Email, Text Messages, CSV files, PDF files, Image Files, Data Visualizations, build our own machine learning model and perform Image detection. We are going to build a web scraper for HackerNews, build a Twitter bot,&nbsp; build the most secure password checker and we will also build some automation tools using Selenium. But the best part? We will build an actual portfolio website using Python that your future employer and customers can contact you at. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Python and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Python skills, or are coming from a different programming language, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no coding experience to someone that can go off, forget about me, and build their own applications and get hired.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:</strong></p><p>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the course!</strong></p>",

Even if you have&nbsp;<strong>ZERO</strong>&nbsp;programming experience.</p><p>I'll take you step-by-step through engaging and fun video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as a Flutter developer.</p><p>The course includes <strong>28+ hours</strong> of HD video tutorials and builds your programming knowledge while making real world apps. e.g. Whatsapp, QuizUp and&nbsp;Yahoo Weather.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be <strong>fluently</strong> programming in <strong>Dart</strong>&nbsp;and be ready to build your own Flutter apps and become a fully fledged Flutter developer.</p><p>You'll also have a portfolio of over 15 apps that you can show off to any potential employer.</p><p><strong>Sign up today, and look forwards to:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Over 28&nbsp;hours of HD 1080p video content, everything you'll ever need to succeed as a Flutter developer.</p></li><li><p>Building over 15 fully-fledged apps including ones that&nbsp;use Firebase Cloud Firestore, StreamBuilder, ListView, networking, external APIs and much much more. </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge you need to start building any app you want</p></li><li><p>$8000+&nbsp;Flutter development bootcamp&nbsp;course materials and curriculum</p></li></ul><p><strong>From Beginner to Flutter Developer with Just One Course</strong></p><p>We know that you're here because you value your time. If you wanted to watch someone program for hours and hours without explaining what they're doing, you'd be on YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>By getting this course, you can be rest assured that the course is carefully thought out and edited. There are&nbsp;beautiful animations that explain all the difficult concepts and we're always on hand to answer student questions.</p><p>So by the end of the course, you'll completely understand:</p><ul><li><p>Fundamental Flutter concepts e.g. Stateful vs. Stateless Widgets, Widget tree, state management, animations, themes and much more.</p></li><li><p>Fundamental Dart concepts e.g. lists, maps, enums, loops, futures, streams, mixins, classes, and much more. </p></li><li><p>Concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP): The type system, variables, functions and methods, inheritance, classes and protocols.</p></li><li><p>Control Structures: Using If/­Else clauses, Switch statements and logic to control the flow of execution.</p></li><li><p>Data Structures: How to work with collections, such as Lists and Maps.</p></li><li><p>Software Design: How to organise and format code for readability and how to implement the Model ­View­ Controller (MVC) design pattern.</p></li><li><p>Networking: How to make asynchronous API calls, store and retrieve data from the cloud, and use the JSON format for server communication.</p></li><li><p>Data Storage: How to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to act as a backend for your Flutter apps.</p></li><li><p>Authentication: How to use log in and register users for your Flutter apps.</p></li><li><p>State Management: How to use setState, prop drilling, lifting state up, callbacks and the Provider package to manage app state.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t waste your time</strong></p><p>Don't waste another minute of your precious life on poor quality videos on YouTube. Or instructors who&nbsp;you can't understand. Or teachers who have no real world in-person teaching experience. Your&nbsp;time is precious. Take this course and find out why everybody is raving about it and why over 35,000 students rated my courses <strong>5 stars</strong>!</p><p><strong>Don't waste your money</strong></p><p>Inside this course, you're getting exactly the same course materials and curriculum as our 12 week in-person programming bootcamp. Instead of spending <strong>$8000+ dollars </strong>and taking time off work, save loads of money by getting this course and do it at your own pace!</p><p><strong>Don't just take my word for it, see what my past students had to say about my courses:</strong></p><p>\"Angela is literally my favorite teacher. Ever. In the entire universe. She is hilarious and teaches in a lighthearted and fun way that is also very clear to understand. I instantly purchased this course as soon as I saw it was released because I know Angela delivers the highest quality educational content possible. 100% recommend this course (as well as every other course she's created). Thank you Angela for helping me as I make a career pivot into becoming a hybrid UX designer/mobile developer!\" - Jacob Pernell</p><p>\"Angela is my favorite Udemy professor for coding courses. Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!\" - Jerome Llouche</p><p><em>\"You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it,&nbsp;as it is the </em><strong><em>BEST programming class</em></strong><em> I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store.\" - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>\"SO GOOD!!!&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\"</em> -&nbsp;Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>\"Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!\"</em> -&nbsp;Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\" -&nbsp;Marc</em></p><p><em>\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.\"</em> -&nbsp;Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!\"</em> -&nbsp;Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different Flutter&nbsp;courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>.\" -&nbsp;Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" -&nbsp;Bryan Pukanda</em></p><p><em>\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which </em><strong><em>i did not want it to end</em></strong><em>. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course.\" - Arun Lakhera</em></p><p><em>\"I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say \"just do this. You will see why later.\" She goes into the </em><strong><em>reason for doing something</em></strong><em> before doing it.\"</em> &nbsp;-&nbsp;Clyde Addison</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that&nbsp;we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for&nbsp;30 days!

This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.</p><p><strong>Start Learning Now.</strong> Hit the Enroll Button!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;DETAILS</strong></p><p><strong><em>RESTful Web Services&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>Step 01 - Initializing a RESTful Services Project with Spring Boot</p></li><li><p>Step 02 - Understanding the RESTful Services we would create in this course</p></li><li><p>Step 03 - Creating a Hello World Service</p></li><li><p>Step 04 - Enhancing the Hello World Service to return a Bean</p></li><li><p>Step 05 - Quick Review of Spring Boot Auto Configuration and Dispatcher Servlet - What's happening in the background?</p></li><li><p>Step 06 - Enhancing the Hello World Service with a Path Variable</p></li><li><p>Step 07 - Creating User Bean and User Service</p></li><li><p>Step 08 - Implementing GET Methods for User Resource</p></li><li><p>Step 09 - Implementing POST Method to create User Resource</p></li><li><p>Step 10 - Enhancing POST Method to return correct HTTP Status Code and Location URI</p></li><li><p>Step 11 - Implementing Exception Handling - 404 Resource Not Found</p></li><li><p>Step 12 - Implementing Generic Exception Handling for all Resources</p></li><li><p>Step 13 - Exercise : User Post Resource and Exception Handling</p></li><li><p>Step 14 - Implementing DELETE Method to delete a User Resource</p></li><li><p>Step 15 - Implementing Validations for RESTful Services</p></li><li><p>Step 16 - Implementing HATEOAS for RESTful Services</p></li><li><p>Step 17 - Overview of Advanced RESTful Service Features</p></li><li><p>Step 18 - Internationalization for RESTful Services</p></li><li><p>Step 19 - Content Negotiation - Implementing Support for XML</p></li><li><p>Step 20 - Configuring Auto Generation of Swagger Documentation</p></li><li><p>Step 21 - Introduction to Swagger Documentation Format</p></li><li><p>Step 22 - Enhancing Swagger Documentation with Custom Annotations</p></li><li><p>Step 23 - Monitoring APIs with Spring Boot Actuator</p></li><li><p>Step 24 - Implementing Static Filtering for RESTful Service</p></li><li><p>Step 25 - Implementing Dynamic Filtering for RESTful Service</p></li><li><p>Step 26 - Versioning RESTful Services - Basic Approach with URIs</p></li><li><p>Step 27 - Versioning RESTful Services - Header and Content Negotiation Approaches</p></li><li><p>Step 28 - Implementing Basic Authentication with Spring Security</p></li><li><p>Step 29 - Overview of Connecting RESTful Service to JPA</p></li><li><p>Step 30 - Creating User Entity and some test data</p></li><li><p>Step 31 - Updating GET methods on User Resource to use JPA</p></li><li><p>Step 32 - Updating POST and DELETE methods on User Resource to use JPA</p></li><li><p>Step 33 - Creating Post Entity and Many to One Relationship with User Entity</p></li><li><p>Step 34 - Implementing a GET service to retrieve all Posts of a User</p></li><li><p>Step 35 - Implementing a POST service to create a Post for a User</p></li><li><p>Step 36 - Richardson Maturity Model</p></li><li><p>Step 37 - RESTful Services Best Practices</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Microservices with Spring Cloud</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>Step 01 - Setting up Limits Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 02 - Creating a hard coded limits service</p></li><li><p>Step 03 - Enhance limits service to pick up configuration from application properties</p></li><li><p>Step 04 - Setting up Spring Cloud Config Server</p></li><li><p>Step 05 - Installing Git and Creating Local Git Repository</p></li><li><p>Step 06 - Connect Spring Cloud Config Server to Local Git Repository</p></li><li><p>Step 07 - Connect Limits Service to Spring Cloud Config Server</p></li><li><p>Step 08 - Configuring Profiles for Limits Service</p></li><li><p>Step 09 - Introduction to Currency Conversion and Currency Exchange Microservices</p></li><li><p>Step 10 - Setting up Currency Exchange Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 11 - Create a simple hard coded currency exchange service</p></li><li><p>Step 12 - Setting up Dynamic Port in the the Response</p></li><li><p>Step 13 - Configure JPA and Initialized Data</p></li><li><p>Step 14 - Create a JPA Repository</p></li><li><p>Step 15 - Setting up Currency Conversion Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 16 - Creating a service for currency conversion</p></li><li><p>Step 17 - Invoking Currency Exchange Microservice from Currency Conversion Microservice</p></li><li><p>Step 18 - Using Feign REST Client for Service Invocation</p></li><li><p>Step 19 - Understand Naming Server and Setting up Eureka Naming Server</p></li><li><p>Step 20 - Connect Currency Conversion Microservice &amp;

Learn how to write better code with types and with the many features offered by TypeScript!</p><p>But, in this course, <strong>we'll not stop after the basics</strong>! You will also learn about more<strong> advanced features </strong>(like decorators)<strong> </strong>and also how to set up <strong>workflows with&nbsp; TypeScript</strong>. This includes a TypeScript-only workflow as well as a <strong>webpack workflow</strong>.</p><p>You'll also learn that you're <strong>not limited to Angular</strong> or plain JavaScript/&nbsp;TypeScript projects. Instead, a complete module covers how you may <strong>use TypeScript with ReactJS</strong> and improve your React code with TypeScript as well.</p><p><strong>Practice what you learn!</strong></p><p>Watching videos is a great way to learn. And to a lot of students, it's the best way. If you also want to practice the things you learn, this course offers you more than that though.

  "description": "<p><strong>Join the most comprehensive Node.js course on Udemy and learn Node in both a practical and a theory-based way!</strong></p><p>-</p><p>Node.js is probably <strong>THE most popular </strong>and modern server-side programming language you can learn these days!</p><p>Node.js developers are in high demand and the language is used for everything from traditional web apps with <strong>server-side rendered views</strong> over <strong>REST&nbsp;APIs</strong> all the way up to <strong>GraphQL APIs</strong> and <strong>real-time web services</strong>. Not to mention its applications in build workflows for projects of all sizes.</p><p><strong>This course will teach you all of that!</strong>&nbsp;From scratch with zero prior knowledge assumed. Though if you do bring some knowledge, you'll of course be able to quickly jump into the course modules that are most interesting to you.</p><p><strong>Here's what you'll learn in this course:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Node.js Basics &amp;&nbsp;Basic Core Modules</p></li><li><p>Parsing Requests &amp;&nbsp;Sending Responses</p></li><li><p>Rendering HTML&nbsp;Dynamically (on the Server)</p></li><li><p>Using Express.js</p></li><li><p>Working with Files and generating PDFs on the Server (on-the-fly)</p></li><li><p>File Up- and Download</p></li><li><p>Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC)&nbsp;Pattern</p></li><li><p>Using Node.js with SQL&nbsp;(MySQL) and Sequelize</p></li><li><p>Using Node.js with NoSQL&nbsp;(MongoDB)&nbsp;and Mongoose</p></li><li><p>Working with Sessions &amp;&nbsp;Cookies</p></li><li><p>User Authentication and Authorization</p></li><li><p>Sending E-Mails</p></li><li><p>Validating User Input</p></li><li><p>Data Pagination</p></li><li><p>Handling Payments with Stripe.js</p></li><li><p>Building REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Authentication in REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>File Upload in REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Building GraphQL&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Authentication in GraphQL&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>File Upload in GraphQL&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Building a Realtime Node.js App with Websockets</p></li><li><p>Automated Testing (Unit Tests)</p></li><li><p>Deploying a Node.js Application</p></li><li><p>Using TypeScript with Node.js</p></li><li><p>Exploring Deno.js</p></li><li><p>And Way More!</p></li></ul><p>Does this look like a lot of content?&nbsp;It certainly is!</p><p>This is not a short course but it is the \"Complete Guide\"&nbsp;on Node.js after all. We'll dive into a lot of topics and we'll not just scratch the surface.</p><p>We'll also not just walk through boring theory and some slides. Instead, we'll build <strong>two major projects</strong>: An online shop (including checkout + payments) and a blog.</p><p>All topics and features of the course will be shown and used in these projects and you'll therefore learn about them in a realistic environment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>If you got <strong>no Node.js experience</strong>, you'll love this course because it starts with zero knowledge assumed. It's the perfect course to become a Node.js developer.</p><p>If you got <strong>basic Node.js experience</strong>, this course is also a perfect match because you can go through the basic modules quickly and you'll benefit from all the deep dives and advanced topics the course covers.</p><p>Are you an <strong>advanced Node.js</strong> user?&nbsp;Check the curriculum then. Maybe you found no other course that shows how to use SQL&nbsp;with Node.js. Or you're interested in GraphQL. Chances are, that you'll get a lot of value out of this course, too!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li><p>NO&nbsp;Node.js knowledge is required at all!</p></li><li><p>NO&nbsp;other programming language knowledge (besides JavaScript, see next point) is required</p></li><li><p>Basic JavaScript knowledge is assumed though - you should at least be willing to pick it up whilst going through the course. A JS&nbsp;refresher module exists to bring you up to the latest syntax quickly</p></li><li><p>Basic HTML&nbsp;+ CSS&nbsp;knowledge helps but is NOT&nbsp;required</p></li></ul>",

  "description": "<p>***&nbsp;As seen on Kickstarter ***</p><p>Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- Why Deep&nbsp;Learning A-Z? ---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z&nbsp;really is different, and stands out from the crowd of&nbsp;other training programs out there:\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>1. ROBUST STRUCTURE&nbsp;</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.&nbsp;With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:&nbsp;<strong>why you are doing what you are doing.&nbsp;</strong>And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive&nbsp;<em>*feel*</em>&nbsp;for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be.&nbsp;This is a game-changer.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>3. EXCITING PROJECTS</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:\n\n&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Recurrent&nbsp;Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the&nbsp;<strong>Netflix $1 Million prize</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><em>*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.</em>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>4. HANDS-ON CODING&nbsp;</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In&nbsp;Deep Learning A-Z we code together with you.&nbsp;Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.&nbsp;Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>This is a course which naturally extends into your career.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>No matter how complex your query, we will be there.&nbsp;The bottom line is we want you to succeed.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>---&nbsp;The Tools&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>So which is better and for what?&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- More&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><em>Theano&nbsp;</em>is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><em>Keras&nbsp;</em>is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- Even More&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><em>Scikit-learn&nbsp;</em>the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it: &nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions\n\n&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Plus, throughout the course we will be using&nbsp;Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays,&nbsp;Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and&nbsp;Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>--- Who Is This Course For?&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,&nbsp;</strong>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.&nbsp;You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>If you already have experience with Deep Learning,&nbsp;</strong>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>---&nbsp;Real-World Case Studies ---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#1 Churn Modelling Problem</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#2 Image Recognition</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#3&nbsp;Stock Price Prediction</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to&nbsp;<em>“Artificial Intelligence”</em>. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.&nbsp;We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>&nbsp;#4&nbsp;Fraud Detection</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course. &nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>#5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix! &nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p><strong>---&nbsp;Summary&nbsp;---</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>Kirill &amp;&nbsp;Hadelin\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>\n\n</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Do you want to work as a Marketing Analyst, a Business Intelligence Analyst, a Data Analyst, or a Data Scientist?</strong></p><p><strong>And you want to acquire the quantitative skills needed for the job?</strong></p><p>Well then, you’ve come to the right place!&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong><em>Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis is here for you! (with TEMPLATES&nbsp;in Excel included)</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is where you start. And it is the perfect beginning! &nbsp; </strong></p><p>In no time, you will acquire the fundamental skills that will enable you to understand complicated statistical analysis directly applicable to real-life situations. We have created a course that is:&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Easy to understand\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Comprehensive\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Practical\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>To the point\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Packed with plenty of exercises and resources&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Data-driven\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Introduces you to the statistical scientific lingo\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Teaches you about data visualization\n\n&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Shows you the main pillars of quant research\n\n&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>It is no secret that a lot of these topics have been explained online.

Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities. Computers and programming languages are like ships at sea. They are fine vessels that will carry you to the desired destination, but it is up to you, the aspiring data scientist or BI analyst, to navigate and point them in the right direction.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Teaching is our passion</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><p>We worked full-time for several months to create the best possible Statistics course, which would deliver the most value to you. We want you to succeed, which is why the course aims to be as engaging as possible. High-quality animations, superb course materials, quiz questions, handouts and course notes, as well as a glossary with all new terms you will learn, are just some of the perks you will get by subscribing.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>What makes this course different from the rest of the Statistics courses out there?</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>High-quality production – HD video and animations (This isn’t a collection of boring lectures!)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Knowledgeable instructor (An adept mathematician and statistician who has competed at an international level)&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Complete training – we will cover all major statistical topics and skills you need to become a marketing analyst, a business intelligence analyst, a data analyst, or a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Extensive Case Studies that will help you reinforce everything you’ve learned &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Excellent support - if you don’t understand a concept or you simply want to drop us a line, you’ll receive an answer within 1 business day &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Dynamic - we don’t want to waste your time! The instructor sets a very good pace throughout the whole course</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why do you need these skills?</strong>\n\n&nbsp; </p><ol><li><p><strong>Salary/Income</strong> – careers in the field of data science are some of the most popular in the corporate world today. And, given that most businesses are starting to realize the advantages of working with the data at their disposal, this trend will only continue to grow&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Promotions</strong> – If you understand Statistics well, you will be able to back up your business ideas with quantitative evidence, which is an easy path to career growth &nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Future</strong> – as we said, the demand for people who understand numbers and data, and can interpret it, is growing exponentially; you’ve probably heard of the number of jobs that will be automated soon, right? Well, data science careers are&nbsp;the ones doing the automating, not getting automated</p></li><li><p><strong>Growth</strong> - this isn’t a boring job. Every day, you will face different challenges that will test your existing skills and require you to learn something new&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ol><p>Please bear in mind that the course comes with Udemy’s 30-day unconditional money-back guarantee.

You'll learn practical techniques to harness the power of AI for various professional applications, from generating text and images to enhancing software development and boosting your creative projects.</p><p><strong><em>! Warning !:</em></strong><em> The majority of our lessons require reading and modifying code in Python (for each lesson marked with \"- Coding\" in the title). Please don't buy this course if you can't code and aren't seriously dedicated to learning technical skills. We've heard from non-technical people they still got value from seeing what's possible, but please don't complain in the reviews ;-)</em></p><p>The number of papers published on AI every month is growing exponentially, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up. The open-source project Stable Diffusion is the fastest growing repository in GitHub in history, and ChatGPT is the fastest growing consumer product in history, hitting 1 million users in less than a week and 100m in a few months.</p><p>This course will walk you through:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to Prompt Engineering and its importance</p></li><li><p>Working with AI tools such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot, GPT-4, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion</p></li><li><p>Understanding the capabilities, limitations, and best practices for each AI tool</p></li><li><p>Mastering tokens, log probabilities, and AI hallucinations</p></li><li><p>Generating and refining lists, summaries, and role prompting</p></li><li><p>Utilizing AI for sentiment analysis, contextualization, and step-by-step reasoning</p></li><li><p>Techniques for overcoming token limits and meta-prompting</p></li><li><p>Advanced AI applications, including inpainting, outpainting, and progressive extraction</p></li><li><p>Leveraging AI for real world projects like generating SEO blog articles and stock photos</p></li><li><p>Advanced tooling for AI engineering like Langchain and AUTOMATIC1111</p></li></ul><p><strong>We've had over 3,000 5-Star Reviews!</strong></p><p>Here's what some students have to say:</p><ul><li><p>\"Practical, fast and yet profound. Super bootcamp.\" – Barbara Herbst</p></li><li><p>\"This is a very good introduction about how AI can be prompt-engineered. The instructor knows what he's talking about and presents it very clearly.\" – Eve Sapsford</p></li><li><p>\"Awesome course for beginners and coders alike! Thoroughly enjoyed myself and the guys delivered some great insights, explaining everything in a straight forward way. Would highly recommend to anyone\" – Jeremy Griffiths</p></li><li><p>\"This is a very good introduction about how AI can be prompt-engineered. The instructor knows what he's talking about and presents it very clearly.\" – Hina Josef Teahuahu</p></li><li><p>\"The course is quite detailed, I think almost every topic is covered. I liked the coding parts especially.\" – Gyanesh Sharma</p></li><li><p>\"Loved how your articulated the value of thoughtfully engineered prompts. The hands-on exercises were insightful.\" – Akshay Chouksey</p></li><li><p>\"Good content but at few steps voice sounds very robotic, which is funny considering the course is about AI.\" – Shrish Shrivastava</p></li><li><p>\"Awesome and Detailed Course. Helped a lot to understand the nuances of prompt engineering in AI.\" – Prasanna Venkatesa Krishnan</p></li><li><p>“The best parts of the online training were demonstrations and real-life hints. Interesting and useful examples”</p></li><li><p>\"Good\" – Jayesh Khandekar</p></li><li><p>\"Mike and James are very good educators and practitioners. Mike also has courses on LinkedIn; together with James, they are running Vexpower. The price is low to collect reviews. It will go up, for sure. GET\" – Periklis Papanikolaou</p></li><li><p>\"This course is a legit practical course for prompt engineering, I learned a lot from this course. The resources that they provided is good, but some of the course (tagged with 'Coding' in the Course Title) is for intermediate or advance people in Python programming. If you are not usual with Python, this will be a challenge (like me), but we can overcome it because they taught us step by step pretty clearly (of course I need to pause or backwards). Thanks for this course, but you guys can provide more real case scenario when using AI (less/without coding maybe...)\" – J Arnold Parlindungan Gultom</p></li></ul><p>So why wait?

  "description": "<p>CI, CD and DevOps have taken over the software development world by storm. Most companies today realize that the practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits like increased business revenue and faster time-to-market. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a plethora of tools available in the CI/CD/DevOps landscape today. Implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment with these tools and frameworks can help us immensely in modernizing our software development lifecycle. It catches us bugs early and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost for software development in startups and enterprise alike.</p><p><br></p><p>But before getting into tools and frameworks, it is important that you get a holistic picture of CI / CD and DevOps. For this, you need to understand where we started from - the old school traditional software development cycle. We will pick holes in the old model, identify pain points and learn how CI / CD and DevOps evolved, one step at a time. Once you build a rock solid foundation using this course, you can move on to more specific tool oriented courses.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are thinking about moving on to CI/CD/DevOps from your old school software development model, this course is for you. Well illustrated with animations to help you grasp a clear understanding of the underlying principles. Once you complete this course, you can take on bigger challenges related to implementation. </p><p><br></p><p>The demand for professionals who have experience with CI/CD/DevOps has been growing steadily over the last few years. The salaries for these skills have gone through the roof and are only bound to go up as the demand for these skills increases. Professionals with CI / CD / DevOps skill set can demand as much as $150K as their yearly compensation as per latest US job and salary surveys. And this is where you start!</p>",

Simply put, we build here an <strong>AI Doctor Chatbot</strong>.</p><p><br></p></li></ol><p>But that's not all... Once you complete the course, you will get <strong>3 extra AIs</strong>: <strong>DDPG</strong>, <strong>Full World Model</strong>, and <strong>Evolution Strategies &amp; Genetic Algorithms</strong>. We build these AIs with ChatGPT for a Self-Driving Car and a Humanoid application. For each of these extra AIs you will get a long video lecture explaining the implementation, a mini PDF, and the Python code.</p><p><br></p><p>Besides, you will get a <strong>free 3-hour extra course on Generative AI and LLMs with Cloud Computing</strong> as a Prize for completing the course.</p><p><br></p><p>And last but not least, here is what you will get with this course:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills&nbsp;–</strong> Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.</p><p><strong>2. Hassle-Free Coding and Code templates –&nbsp;</strong>We will build all our AIs in Google Colab, which means that we will have absolutely NO hassle installing libraries or packages because everything is already pre-installed in Google Colab notebooks. Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates (in .py and .ipynb) for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.</p><p><strong>3. Intuition Tutorials –</strong>&nbsp;Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in AI for much better results down the line.</p><p><strong>4. Real-world solutions –</strong>&nbsp;You’ll achieve your goal in not only one AI model but in 5. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.</p><p><strong>5. In-course support –</strong>&nbsp;We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.</p><p><br></p><p>So, are you ready to embrace the fascinating world of AI?</p><p>Come join us, never stop learning, and enjoy AI!</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT? </strong></p><p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and growing faster than any other programming language. As a developer, you can use JavaScript to <strong>build web and mobile apps, real-time networking apps, command-line tools, and games</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p><p><strong>4 REASONS TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT </strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>JavaScript is a key tool for front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.</li><li>The average annual salary for a JavaScript developer is<strong> $72,000.</strong></li><li><strong></strong>Companies like Walmart, Netflix, and PayPal run big internal applications around JavaScript.</li><li>Having strong JavaScript knowledge will help you land your dream job.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A STEP-BY-STEP, BEGINNER-FRIENDLY COURSE</strong></p><p>This course is your first step towards a new career in web or mobile development. Here is what you get when enroll in this course: </p>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>6 hours </strong>of HD videos</li><li><strong>Bite-sized and easy-to-digest videos with \"no fluff”</strong> </li><li><strong>30 exercises</strong> and challenges with solutions</li><li><strong>Expert tips</strong> to become a JavaScript wizard</li><li><strong>No more wasted time</strong> on disconnected, out-of-date tutorials</li><li><strong>Learn at your own pace </strong>- take your time if required</li><li><strong>Unlimited access</strong> - watch the course as many times as you wish</li><li><strong>30-day money-back guarantee </strong>- try it risk free! You have nothing to lose. </li><li><strong>Certificate of completion</strong> to present to your current or future employer</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p><p><strong>WHY THIS COURSE?</strong></p><p>There are several JavaScript courses on Udemy. So, what makes this course different? Here are 5 reasons: </p><ul><li><strong>Taught by a senior coder and best-selling instructor</strong> - Mosh Hamedani </li><li>Mosh has <strong>17 years of experience</strong> as a software engineer</li><li>He has produced <strong>19 courses</strong> and many of them are <strong>best-selling</strong> courses </li><li>He has taught over<strong> 200,000 students </strong>in 192 countries </li><li><strong>No fluff or unnecessary repetition</strong> - don't waste your time on long courses </li><li><strong>Clear, concise, and practical training </strong>- start coding right away </li><li><strong>Learn how to think like a programmer </strong>- most, if not all, courses just teach you JavaScript features, not the art of problem solving </li><li><strong>JavaScript interview questions </strong>- many of the exercises in the course are picked from popular interview questions </li><li><strong>Fun and engaging </strong>- just read Mosh's reviews and see what his students have to say</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR? </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Aspiring developers</strong> - perhaps you learned a little bit of HTML and CSS and want to take your first JavaScript programming course. This course is an ideal starting point.  </li><li><strong>Experienced developers with no degree in computer science</strong> - there are a lot of self-taught web developers out there who cannot solve basic programming problems, because they never attended a college. Don't be one of those! This course teaches you the fundamental programming skills that every developer must know. </li><li><strong>Anyone who wants to better understand JavaScript</strong> - chances are you've taken another course but didn't understand certain topics well. You can take this course to fill the gaps and strengthen your understanding of JavaScript. </li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE NEEDED</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>You don't need familiarity with JavaScript to take this course. You'll learn everything from scratch, step-by-step. A very basic familiarity with HTML will be helpful but it is not required.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><br></p><p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ARE YOU READY TO MAKE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS BECOMING A WEB OR MOBILE DEVELOPER?</strong></p><p>Stop wasting your time on disconnected tutorials or super long courses. Enroll in the course to get started. With a 30-day money-back guarantee, what do you have to lose? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>",

Este curso é completo e para você!<br>Programador experiente em outra linguagem de programação e quer aprender Python 3? Este curso também é completo e pra você!</p><p>Mesmo que não tenha trabalhado com programação antes (ou se já é um desenvolvedor experiente), vou te guiar em todos os passos até que comece a criar seus próprios scripts, programas, sites e/ou automatizações em Python (na versão 3). Continuo atualizando constantemente este curso.</p><p>Vamos iniciar do zero, desde a instalação do Python 3 até as partes bem mais avançadas da linguagem, como módulos de terceiros, bases de dados (MySQL, SQLite, etc...), web scraping, padrões de projeto GoF (Design Patterns), expressões regulares (RegEx) e muito mais. Alguns dos módulos que abordaremos&nbsp; já são consagrados no mercado, como Django, Selenium, SQLite, Pytest, Unittest e vários outros.</p><p>Criaremos projetos reais do zero, como um gerador e validador de CPF, uma seção dedicada ao PySide6 para interfaces gráficas com projetos, sites usando Django e mais. Como nosso curso é constantemente atualizado, essa descrição não vai conter tudo o que está nas aulas (tem mais coisas lá no curso).</p><p>Também faremos deploy da nossa aplicação em um servidor com Linux no Google Cloud Platform, ou seja, você vai ter que colocar a mão na massa para subir e configurar um servidor Linux e suas chaves SSH junto comigo (claro que te guiarei em todos os passos). </p><p>Este curso está dividido da seguinte maneira:</p><ul><li><p>Para nível iniciante: Lógica de programação (partes básicas de Python 3)</p></li><li><p>Para nível intermediário: Programação procedural e funcional (funções, repetições e partes relacionadas)</p></li><li><p>Para experientes: Programação orientada a objetos (no modo Pythônico) - Inclui seção específica de POO com Padrões de Projeto GoF</p></li><li><p>Módulos úteis: inclui aulas de módulos específicos do Python e de terceiros</p></li><li><p>Bases de dados: inclui aulas relacionadas com bases de dados no Python</p></li><li><p>Django: Criaremos alguns projetos (sites) utilizando o Django.</p></li><li><p>Interface Gráfica com PySide6 (Qt 6) com Python</p></li><li><p>Testes no Python (com TDD básico)</p></li><li><p>Bônus: Expressões Regulares (Regex - re)</p></li><li><p>Design Patterns (Padrões de projeto - GoF) - Programação Orientada a Objetos Avançada</p></li><li><p>Bônus: seções de HTML5 e CSS3</p></li><li><p>Bônus:&nbsp;seção de SQL&nbsp;com MySQL</p></li></ul><p>Também vamos falar sobre interface gráfica no Python para criação de janelas, criação de sites com Django e muito mais. Além de tudo isso, temos uma seção específica onde você aprender a executar as consultas mais comuns em bases de dados SQL (MySQL). Após essa seção o aluno será capaz de criar, apagar, atualizar, ler e fazer relações entre tabelas da base de dados.</p><p>Ao terminar esse curso, você poderá conseguir sua sonhada vaga no Mercado de trabalho como dev, já que todos os nossos projetos são voltados para a prática e não apenas teoria.</p><p>Venha aprender a linguagem que mais cresce neste ano agora!</p>",
